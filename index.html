        1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
        is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"<br>
        2.Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
        BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"<br>
